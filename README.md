# Splash Frontend Developer Test

## System Requirements

The coding challenge requries the following:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Version 10 or higher
* A [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Client

## Setup

1. Fork the `frontend-developer-test` repository to your personal GitHub account.
1. Clone the `frontend-developer-test` repository from your personal GitHub account onto your development machine.

## The Challenge

Using React, create a To-Do application to manage a user's daily To-Do items. The application will allow the user to manage the todo items including create, update and delete.

Additionally, there are questions in the [/documentation](./documentation/) folder to support your solution.

## Requirements

1. The solution should be broken down to reusable components
1. Error handling should be included when creating, editing and deleting todo items
1. Consideration into the initial state when there are no todo items, all items have been deleted, and all items have been completed

Not all requirements may have been provided, you may interpret some direction based on the above and ask additional questions wherever necessary.

## Tips

* It is not requirement to connect to an external API and persist data
* Exploring all of the code may provide you with useful hints
* Readable code over complexity is desired
* Keep it simple
* Input validation is not required
* Installation instructions will go a long way

## Submission

Once all your unit tests pass, push your code to the forked `frontend-developer-test` on your personal GitHub account, and send us the link to your GitHub repository with your solution.
